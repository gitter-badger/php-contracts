php-contracts
=============

A curated of mature interfaces to build components on.

Rules:

* A project get on this list if it only consists of interfaces that have the character of a contract.
* The interfaces are well documented.
* There are implementations that show the practical benefit of the offered interfaces.
* The interfaces must comply with [PSR-1](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-1/) and [PSR-2](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/).
